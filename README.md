# Polymarket Trade Monitor

A Python script that monitors large trades on Polymarket and analyzes trader history in real-time.

## Features

- üîç **Real-time Monitoring**: Continuously monitors Polymarket for new trades (default: every 30 seconds)
- üí∞ **Large Trade Detection**: Filters and logs trades over $5,000 (configurable threshold)
- üìä **Detailed Market Information**: 
  - Market title and description
  - Market ID (condition ID) for tracking
  - Market category (e.g., "US-current-affairs", "crypto")
  - Market tags (when available)
  - Market slug and event slug for URL construction
- üë§ **Trader Analysis**: For each large trade, automatically analyzes the complete trader history:
  - Username and pseudonym
  - Total number of historical trades on Polymarket
  - Total volume traded across all markets
  - Number of unique markets traded
  - First and latest trade timestamps
- üìù **Comprehensive Logging**: 
  - Human-readable logs to console and file (`polymarket_trades.log`)
  - Machine-readable JSON output (`large_trades.json`)
  - Logs when no large trades are found in each polling cycle

## Installation

### Option 1: Docker (Recommended for Production)

The easiest way to deploy:

```bash
# From project root
cd docker
docker-compose up -d

# View logs
docker-compose logs -f
```

See [DOCKER.md](DOCKER.md) for complete Docker documentation.

### Option 2: Python Virtual Environment

Run the setup script which will create a virtual environment and install dependencies:

```bash
./scripts/setup.sh
```

### Option 3: Manual Setup

1. Create a virtual environment:
```bash
python3 -m venv venv
```

2. Activate the virtual environment:
```bash
source venv/bin/activate
```

3. Install dependencies:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage

### Basic Usage

Run the monitor with default settings ($5,000 threshold, 30-second polling):

**Option 1: Easiest - Use the run script**
```bash
# From project root
./scripts/run.sh
```

**Option 2: Using the virtual environment directly**
```bash
./venv/bin/python polymarket_monitor.py
```

**Option 3: Activate virtual environment first**
```bash
source venv/bin/activate
python polymarket_monitor.py
```

**Option 4: Docker**
```bash
cd docker
docker-compose up -d
```

### Testing

Test the API connection before running the monitor:

```bash
./venv/bin/python tests/test_api.py
```

All test and debug scripts are located in the `tests/` directory.

### Advanced Usage

You can customize the monitor by editing the script's `main()` function:

```python
monitor = PolymarketMonitor(
    threshold=10000,     # Monitor trades over $10,000
    poll_interval=30     # Check every 30 seconds
)
```

### Output Files

- `polymarket_trades.log` - Human-readable log with detailed trade and trader information
- `large_trades.json` - JSON-formatted log for programmatic access

## Example Output

```

## API Information

This script uses the Polymarket public APIs:
- **Trade Data API**: `https://data-api.polymarket.com/trades`
  - Fetches real-time trade information
  - Includes trader usernames and market titles
- **Market Details API**: `https://gamma-api.polymarket.com/markets`
  - Fetches market categories and additional metadata
  - Cached to minimize API calls

## Configuration

Key parameters you can adjust:

| Parameter | Default | Description |
|-----------|---------|-------------|
| `threshold` | 5000 | Minimum trade value in USD to log |
| `poll_interval` | 30 | Seconds between API checks |

## Notes

- The script maintains a set of seen transaction hashes to avoid duplicate logging
- API requests are rate-limited by the polling interval
- Trade value is calculated as `size √ó price` where size is in tokens and price is the token price
- Market details are cached to reduce API calls and improve performance
- Timestamps are in Unix epoch format (seconds since January 1, 1970)

## Stopping the Monitor

Press `Ctrl+C` to gracefully stop the monitoring script.

## Troubleshooting

**No trades appearing?**
- Check your internet connection
- Verify the Polymarket API is accessible
- Consider lowering the threshold or increasing the limit of trades fetched

**API errors?**
- The script will log errors and continue running
- Check the log file for detailed error messages
